      The year is 2340, and the place is Isotopia. It's the start of another sunny day. Well, it might be anyway -- Isotopia is a subterranean metropolis, far away from the fears (and infections) of the surface world. Every day is the same as the last: wake up; exercise; work; sleep; do it all again. The banal repetition and isolation of its citizens has proven so effective that Isotopia would appear to exist on a higher state of being. . until someone dies. In fact, a lot of people die. When Calla, an inquisitive woman who longs for more, begins asking questions, she isn't told to stop so much as threatened to do so. But she doesn't stop. Calla not only continues to ask questions, but following clues will lead her all the way to the surface. Who knows what she'll find there? And who knows how many will follow her?
